# Parallax-challenge

## The Mission
In this repository you will find some images.
If you position them over eachother in the right order you will get a pretty background.
Our goal now will be to animate each piece based on how far it is in the background.
The first layer (the ground) will move fastest, the last (the sky) will be static.
