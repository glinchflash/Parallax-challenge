# Parallax-challenge

## The Mission
In this repository you will find some images.
If you position them over eachother in the right order you will get a pretty background.
Our goal now will be to animate each piece based on how far it is in the background.
The first layer (the ground) will move fastest, the last (the sky) will be static.


### Must-haves
- [ ] A page with a moving background that looks natural
- [ ] Something of your personal choosing to enhance the page, go take a look at the suggestions or come up with something yourself!

### Plan of attack
- do some research on how to make this happen
- do some research on topics, creative idea's
- make small TO-DO's like this one for the bigger parts of the challenge
